This project is designed as part of a larger backend architecture for Turkcell, featuring microservices, CQRS, and Hexagonal Architecture. It includes key features like user and package management, Shake to Win, and many more!

### 🔧 Technologies & Tools
Here are some of the core technologies that make this project powerful:

- Spring Boot 🛠️: The backbone for building microservices.
- CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) 💡: Separates read and write logic for better performance.
- Hexagonal Architecture ⚙️: Ensures core business logic is decoupled from external systems like databases.
- Spring Cloud Config 🔑: Externalized configuration management.
- Eureka 🌐: Service discovery in the microservices ecosystem.
- Zipkin 🧵: Distributed tracing for monitoring and debugging.
- Kafka 📡: Asynchronous messaging for service communication.
- Docker 🐳: Containerization for easy deployment and scaling.
- Redis 🔥: Caching for performance improvement.
- Elasticsearch 🔍: Powerful search capabilities for fast data retrieval.
- API Gateway 🔐: Handles routing, security, and rate limiting.
- Saga Pattern 🔄: Manages long-running transactions in a distributed environment (coming soon!).
- MongoDB 🗄️: NoSQL database for flexible, scalable document-based storage.
- PostgreSQL 🛠️: Relational database for structured data storage with strong consistency, transactions, and complex queries.

# 🎯 Features
User & Package Management: Users can buy, update, and manage both main packages and extra packages.
Extra Features: Packages can include additional services like YouTube, SSport, and extra GB. 📱📺
Shake to Win 🎲: Every Monday, users can shake their devices to win random packages! 🎉
Zipkin Tracing 🧭: Track the flow of requests between microservices for better monitoring and debugging.
CQRS 🔄: Commands (create, update, delete) and Queries (fetch) are handled separately to optimize system performance.
Hexagonal Architecture 🏗️: Keeps the core logic isolated from external systems for better scalability and maintainability.
Kafka Integration 🗣️: Microservices communicate asynchronously using Kafka, making the system more resilient.

# 📈 Planned Features
Saga Pattern for Payments 💳: A new Payment Service will be built using the Saga Pattern to ensure long-running transactions are handled consistently and reliably.
Redis Integration ⚡: To cache frequently accessed data, reducing database load.
Elasticsearch 🔎: Integrate Elasticsearch for improved searching and analytics.
API Gateway 🌍: An API Gateway will be added to centralize routing, manage security, and handle cross-cutting concerns.

# Usage 🔍
The User and Package modules are fully functional. You can add, update, delete, and fetch user and package data.
Shake to Win 🎲 is available every Monday — let the users shake their devices for a chance to win random packages! 🎉
All interactions are traceable with Zipkin to ensure smooth microservices communication.
Planned Future Updates 🚀
Saga Pattern 🔄: A Payment Service will be added using the Saga pattern for reliable transaction management.
Redis and Elasticsearch ⚡🔍: Integrating Redis for faster access and Elasticsearch for better search performance.
API Gateway 🌍: A gateway for routing, security, and cross-cutting concerns.
Docker 🐋: Full containerization of all microservices.
